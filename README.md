The Chart Project contains two screens. First screen contains chart data, users list, transactions. 
In second screen you can see saved cards and also transactions.

How to Use
Step 1:

Download or clone this repo by using the link below:

https://github.com/AshotKhachatryan1995/test_chart_app.git

Go to project root and execute the following command in console to get the required dependencies:

flutter pub get 
Step 3:

This project uses inject library that works with code generation, execute the following command to generate files:

flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
or watch command in order to keep the source code synced automatically:

flutter packages pub run build_runner watch
Hide Generated Files
In-order to hide generated files, navigate to Android Studio -> Preferences -> Editor -> File Types and paste the below lines under ignore files and folders section:

*.inject.summary;*.inject.dart;*.g.dart;
In Visual Studio Code, navigate to Preferences -> Settings and search for Files:Exclude. Add the following patterns:

**/*.g.dart 
 
Folder Structure
Here is the core folder structure which flutter provides.

flutter-app/
|- android
|- build
|- ios
|- lib
|- test
Here is the folder structure we have been using in this project

lib/
|- constants/
|- middleware/
|- shared/
|- main.dart
|- home.dart
|- saved_cards_screen.dart

Now, lets dive into the lib folder which has the main code for the application.

1- constants - All the application level constants are defined in this directory with-in their respective files. This directory contains the constants for `theme`, `colors`.
2- middleware - Contains repositories, blocs, notifiers, models.
3- shared - Contains all shared widgets in the app. 
4- main.dart - This is the starting point of the application. The application routes configurations are defined in this file.
5- home.dart - This is a first screen of our Charts Project. 
6- saved_cards_screen.dart - This is a second screen of our Charts Project.
